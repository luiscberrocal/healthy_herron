# Implementation Plan: Fasting Tracker App

**Branch**: `001-fasting-app` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-fasting-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: Build a Django web application for tracking fasting periods with user-owned Fast records supporting CRUD operations, emotional status tracking, real-time elapsed time updates, and object-level permissions via django-guardian. Core features include starting/ending fasts, viewing history with emotional states and comments, and real-time UI updates every 15 seconds for active fasts.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13  
**Primary Dependencies**: Django 5.2.7, django-model-utils, django-guardian, Tailwind CSS, pytest, FactoryBoy  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (configured in settings)  
**Testing**: pytest with class-based tests and FactoryBoy  
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive design mandatory)
**Project Type**: Django web application  
**Performance Goals**: Support 1000-10,000 users, up to 100,000 fast records, 2-second response times for CRUD operations  
**Constraints**: Responsive design mandatory, minimal dependencies, clean code standards, real-time updates every 15 seconds  
**Scale/Scope**: Medium scale (1000-10,000 users, 100,000 fast records), object-level permissions, emotional status tracking, JavaScript for real-time updates

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial Check**: ✅ All requirements met
**Post-Design Check**: ✅ Design validates all constitution principles

- [x] **Clean Code**: All code follows PEP 8, uses meaningful names, single responsibilities
  - ✅ Models use clear naming (Fast, FastManager)
  - ✅ Views follow single responsibility (FastListView, FastDetailView, etc.)
  - ✅ API endpoints use RESTful conventions
  - ✅ Form classes handle single concerns (FastForm, FastEndForm)

- [x] **Simple UX**: User interfaces prioritize simplicity and usability  
  - ✅ Simple dashboard with clear "Start Fast" action
  - ✅ Intuitive fast history with chronological ordering
  - ✅ Clear form layouts for ending fasts with emotional status
  - ✅ Real-time elapsed time updates without user interaction

- [x] **Responsive Design**: Full responsive design with Tailwind CSS, tested on multiple screen sizes
  - ✅ Tailwind CSS classes used throughout templates
  - ✅ Mobile-first responsive design approach documented
  - ✅ Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices
  - ✅ CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layouts

- [x] **Minimal Dependencies**: New dependencies justified (django-guardian for object-level permissions), using existing libraries from pyproject.toml
  - ✅ Only one new dependency: django-guardian (required by specification FR-013)
  - ✅ Reusing existing Django, Tailwind CSS, pytest, FactoryBoy
  - ✅ JavaScript solution uses vanilla JS without additional frameworks
  - ✅ PostgreSQL already configured in project settings

- [x] **Django Best Practices**: Apps under healthy_herron package, models inherit from AuditableModel + TimeStampedModel, APIs in api package with class-based views
  - ✅ App created as `healthy_herron.fasting` package
  - ✅ Fast model inherits from both AuditableModel and TimeStampedModel
  - ✅ API organized in `healthy_herron.fasting.api` package
  - ✅ All views are class-based (FastListView, FastDetailView, etc.)
  - ✅ Templates in required `fasting/templates` directory

- [x] **Testing Standards**: Class-based pytest tests, FactoryBoy factories for all models
  - ✅ FastFactory and CompletedFastFactory created for Fast model
  - ✅ Test structure organized in `tests` package within app
  - ✅ Tests planned for models, views, API, and permissions
  - ✅ Guardian permissions integration in factory post_generation hooks

**Structure Decision**: Single Django app structure selected as this is a focused feature with clear boundaries. The fasting app will be created under the healthy_herron package following project conventions, with templates in the required fasting/templates directory and object-level permissions via django-guardian.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |

| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
