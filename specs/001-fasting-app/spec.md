# Feature Specification: Fasting Tracker App

**Feature Branch**: `001-fasting-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a fasting app. This app is to keep track of starting and ending time for a fast. Propose a Fast model. The model should be owned by a user an only that user should have access to the Fast data. Create create, read, update, delete and list views. Use django-guardian to restrict access to the objects. Include the the the templates in the fasting/templates directory."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start New Fast (Priority: P1)

A user wants to begin tracking a new fasting period by recording the start time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without the ability to start a fast, the app has no value. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, clicking "Start Fast", and verifying a new fast record is created with the current timestamp and user ownership.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user on the fasting dashboard, **When** they click "Start Fast", **Then** a new fast record is created with the current timestamp as start time and the user as owner
2. **Given** a user who already has an active (unfinished) fast, **When** they try to start a new fast, **Then** they see an error message preventing multiple active fasts
3. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they try to access the start fast feature, **Then** they are redirected to login

---

### User Story 2 - End Active Fast (Priority: P1)

A user wants to complete their current fasting period by recording the end time.

**Why this priority**: Completing a fast is equally critical to starting one - users need to track the full duration of their fasting periods.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a fast, then clicking "End Fast" and verifying the end timestamp is recorded and fast duration is calculated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with an active fast, **When** they click "End Fast", **Then** the current timestamp is recorded as end time and fast duration is calculated
2. **Given** a user with no active fast, **When** they try to end a fast, **Then** they see a message indicating no active fast exists
3. **Given** a user tries to end another user's fast, **When** they attempt access, **Then** they receive an access denied error

---

### User Story 3 - View Fasting History (Priority: P2)

A user wants to see their complete history of completed fasts to track their fasting patterns and progress.

**Why this priority**: Historical data provides motivation and insights but isn't required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple completed fasts and verifying they appear in chronological order with duration calculations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with completed fasts, **When** they view their fasting history, **Then** they see all their fasts ordered by most recent first with start time, end time, and duration
2. **Given** a user with no fasting history, **When** they view the history page, **Then** they see a message encouraging them to start their first fast
3. **Given** a user tries to view another user's fasting history, **When** they attempt access, **Then** they can only see their own fasts

---

### User Story 4 - Edit Fast Details (Priority: P3)

A user wants to modify the start or end time of a previously recorded fast to correct mistakes.

**Why this priority**: Error correction is helpful but not essential for core functionality. Users can work around this by deleting and recreating fasts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by editing an existing fast's times and verifying the changes are saved and duration is recalculated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user viewing their fast details, **When** they click "Edit" and modify start/end times, **Then** the changes are saved and duration is recalculated
2. **Given** a user enters invalid times (end before start), **When** they try to save, **Then** they see validation errors
3. **Given** a user tries to edit another user's fast, **When** they attempt access, **Then** they receive an access denied error

---

### User Story 5 - Delete Fast Record (Priority: P3)

A user wants to remove a fast record from their history if it was recorded by mistake.

**Why this priority**: Data cleanup capability is nice-to-have but not essential for primary use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting a fast record and verifying it no longer appears in the user's history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user viewing their fast details, **When** they click "Delete" and confirm, **Then** the fast is permanently removed from their history
2. **Given** a user tries to delete another user's fast, **When** they attempt access, **Then** they receive an access denied error
3. **Given** a user clicks delete but cancels the confirmation, **When** they cancel, **Then** the fast remains unchanged

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user starts a fast but never ends it (abandoned fast handling)?
- How does the system handle concurrent requests to start/end fasts from the same user?
- What happens if a user's session expires while they have an active fast?
- How are time zones handled for users in different locations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated users to start a new fasting period with current timestamp
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to end their active fasting period with current timestamp  
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent users from having multiple active (unfinished) fasts simultaneously
- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate and display fasting duration when a fast is completed
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide complete CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for fast records
- **FR-006**: System MUST restrict access so users can only view and modify their own fast records
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement object-level permissions using django-guardian
- **FR-008**: System MUST store templates in the fasting/templates directory following Django conventions
- **FR-009**: System MUST display fasting history ordered by most recent first
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that fast end time is after start time
- **FR-011**: System MUST require user authentication for all fasting operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide user-friendly error messages for permission denials and validation failures

### Key Entities

- **Fast**: Represents a single fasting period with start time, end time (optional), duration calculation, and user ownership
- **User**: Existing Django user model that owns Fast records and provides authentication context

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can start a new fast in under 5 seconds from the dashboard
- **SC-002**: Users can view their complete fasting history in under 3 seconds
- **SC-003**: Fast duration calculations are accurate to the minute
- **SC-004**: 100% of fast records are properly isolated between users (no cross-user data access)
- **SC-005**: System prevents creation of invalid fast records (end time before start time) with clear error messages
- **SC-006**: All CRUD operations complete successfully for authorized users within 2 seconds

## Assumptions

- Django user authentication system is already implemented and functional
- Users understand basic fasting concepts and terminology
- django-guardian library will be added to project dependencies
- Users will primarily access the app via web browsers (responsive design not specified but assumed)
- Time zone handling will use server time zone (user-specific time zones not specified)
- Fast records are persistent and do not automatically expire or archive
