# Feature Specification: Fasting Tracker App

**Feature Branch**: `001-fasting-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a fasting app. This app is to keep track of starting and ending time for a fast. Propose a Fast model. The model should be owned by a user an only that user should have access to the Fast data. Create create, read, update, delete and list views. Use django-guardian to restrict access to the objects. Include the the the templates in the fasting/templates directory."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start New Fast (Priority: P1)

A user wants to begin tracking a new fasting period by recording the start time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without the ability to start a fast, the app has no value. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, clicking "Start Fast", and verifying a new fast record is created with the current timestamp and user ownership.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user on the fasting dashboard, **When** they click "Start Fast", **Then** a new fast record is created with the current timestamp as start time and the user as owner
2. **Given** a user who already has an active (unfinished) fast, **When** they try to start a new fast, **Then** they see an error message preventing multiple active fasts
3. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they try to access the start fast feature, **Then** they are redirected to login

---

### User Story 2 - End Active Fast (Priority: P1)

A user wants to complete their current fasting period by recording the end time, their emotional state, and optional comments about the experience.

**Why this priority**: Completing a fast is equally critical to starting one - users need to track the full duration of their fasting periods and reflect on their experience for personal growth and pattern recognition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a fast, then clicking "End Fast", selecting an emotional state, adding optional comments, and verifying all data is recorded properly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with an active fast, **When** they click "End Fast", **Then** they see a form with end time, emotional state selection (Energized, Satisfied, Challenging, Difficult), and optional comment field
2. **Given** a user completing a fast, **When** they select an emotional state and submit, **Then** the fast is completed with end timestamp, emotional status, and comments recorded
3. **Given** a user completing a fast, **When** they skip the emotional state selection, **Then** they see a validation message requiring emotional state selection
4. **Given** a user with no active fast, **When** they try to end a fast, **Then** they see a message indicating no active fast exists
5. **Given** a user tries to end another user's fast, **When** they attempt access, **Then** they receive an access denied error

---

### User Story 3 - View Fasting History (Priority: P2)

A user wants to see their complete history of completed fasts to track their fasting patterns and progress.

**Why this priority**: Historical data provides motivation and insights but isn't required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating multiple completed fasts and verifying they appear in chronological order with duration calculations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with completed fasts, **When** they view their fasting history, **Then** they see all their fasts ordered by most recent first with start time, end time, duration, elapsed hours, emotional status, and comments
2. **Given** a user with an active (ongoing) fast, **When** they view the fast details, **Then** they see the elapsed hours updating automatically every 15 seconds without requiring page refresh
3. **Given** a user viewing active fast details, **When** they remain on the page for at least 30 seconds, **Then** they observe the elapsed time increment automatically at 15-second intervals
4. **Given** a user viewing fast details, **When** they see completed fasts with emotional status, **Then** each fast displays the emotional state icon/badge and any comments provided
5. **Given** a user with no fasting history, **When** they view the history page, **Then** they see a message encouraging them to start their first fast
6. **Given** a user tries to view another user's fasting history, **When** they attempt access, **Then** they can only see their own fasts

---

### User Story 4 - Edit Fast Details (Priority: P3)

A user wants to modify the start or end time of a previously recorded fast to correct mistakes.

**Why this priority**: Error correction is helpful but not essential for core functionality. Users can work around this by deleting and recreating fasts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by editing an existing fast's times, emotional status, and comments, then verifying the changes are saved and duration is recalculated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user viewing their fast details, **When** they click "Edit" and modify start/end times, emotional status, or comments, **Then** the changes are saved and duration is recalculated
2. **Given** a user editing a fast, **When** they change the emotional status from one state to another, **Then** the new emotional status is saved and displayed
3. **Given** a user enters invalid times (end before start), **When** they try to save, **Then** they see validation errors
4. **Given** a user tries to edit another user's fast, **When** they attempt access, **Then** they receive an access denied error

---

### User Story 5 - Delete Fast Record (Priority: P3)

A user wants to remove a fast record from their history if it was recorded by mistake.

**Why this priority**: Data cleanup capability is nice-to-have but not essential for primary use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting a fast record and verifying it no longer appears in the user's history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user viewing their fast details, **When** they click "Delete" and confirm, **Then** the fast is permanently removed from their history
2. **Given** a user tries to delete another user's fast, **When** they attempt access, **Then** they receive an access denied error
3. **Given** a user clicks delete but cancels the confirmation, **When** they cancel, **Then** the fast remains unchanged

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user starts a fast but never ends it (abandoned fast handling)?
- How does the system handle concurrent requests to start/end fasts from the same user?
- What happens if a user's session expires while they have an active fast?
- How are time zones handled for users in different locations?
- What happens if a user closes the browser while selecting emotional status during fast completion?
- How does the system handle very long comments (character limits and validation)?
- What happens if the predefined emotional states need to be updated or expanded in the future?
- How are emotional status statistics and trends calculated over time?
- What happens when the 15-second auto-update fails due to network connectivity issues?
- How does the system handle browser tab switching or background tab behavior affecting real-time updates?
- What happens if multiple browser tabs are open showing the same active fast details?
- How does the system behave when the user's computer goes to sleep while viewing active fast details?

## Assumptions

- Django user authentication system is already implemented and functional
- Users understand basic fasting concepts and terminology
- django-guardian library will be added to project dependencies
- Users will primarily access the app via web browsers (responsive design not specified but assumed)
- Time zone handling will use server time zone (user-specific time zones not specified)
- Fast records are persistent and do not automatically expire or archive
- The four predefined emotional states (Energized, Satisfied, Challenging, Difficult) cover the primary range of fasting experiences
- Comments field will have reasonable character limits (500-1000 characters assumed)
- Emotional status is required for completed fasts but comments remain optional
- Users will find value in tracking emotional patterns alongside fasting duration data
- Users will typically keep the fast details page open for extended periods during active fasts
- JavaScript is enabled in user browsers to support real-time elapsed time updates
- Network connectivity is generally stable for real-time updates (graceful degradation assumed for intermittent connectivity)
- 15-second update interval provides good balance between real-time feel and server load
