**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 45 tasks across 7 phases
- **User Stories**: 4 stories (US1-US4) with priority P1, P1, P2, P3
- **MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Start New Fast) - 8 implementation tasks (T021-T021)
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 32 parallelizable tasks marked with [P]
- **Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story can be tested independently

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order

```text
Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Foundation) ‚Üí All User Stories can run in parallel

User Story 1 (MVP) ‚Üê Independent
User Story 2       ‚Üê Depends on US1 (needs Fast model)
User Story 3       ‚Üê Independent (can use existing Fast records)
User Story 4       ‚Üê Depends on US3 (needs fast detail views)
```

### Critical Dependencies

- **Foundation Phase**: Must complete before any user story work
- **US1 (Start Fast)**: Blocks US2 (need fasts to end)
- **US3 (View History)**: Blocks US4 (need detail views to edit)
- **All other tasks**: Can run in parallel within phases

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 2 Foundation (can work in parallel):
- Developer A: Fast model (T006)
- Developer B: Permission signals (T007) + Test factories (T008)
- Developer C: Session utilities (T010) + Template structure (T011)

### Phase 3 User Story 1 (can work in parallel):
- Developer A: Forms (T012) + Views (T021)
- Developer B: Templates (T021, T021) + CSS (T021)
- Developer C: Validation (T021) + URLs (T021)

### Phase 4-6 User Stories (can work in parallel):
- Developer A: US2 (End Fast)
- Developer B: US3 (View History)  
- Developer C: US4 (Edit Details)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Delivery (Phase 1-3)
Focus on User Story 1 for initial release:
- Basic fast tracking (start/end)
- Dashboard with timer
- User authentication and permissions
- **Estimated effort**: 8 implementation tasks (T007-T021)

### Incremental Releases
- **Release 1**: US1 (Start Fast) - Core functionality
- **Release 2**: US1 + US2 (End Fast) - Complete cycle
- **Release 3**: US1 + US2 + US3 (History) - Analytics
- **Release 4**: All features + US4 (Edit) - Full feature set

### Testing Strategy
Each user story can be tested independently:
- **US1**: Create account ‚Üí Start fast ‚Üí Verify dashboard timer
- **US2**: Start fast ‚Üí End fast ‚Üí Verify emotional status saved  
- **US3**: Multiple fasts ‚Üí View history ‚Üí Verify chronological order
- **US4**: Existing fast ‚Üí Edit details ‚Üí Verify changes saved

This task structure enables parallel development while maintaining clear dependencies and deliverable increments.
